# Onion-Price-Prediction
Price prediction helps the farmers and also Government to make effective decision. The aim of making this project is that every farmer can get the best price of onion in the market-city.


1. Introduction:
This project is made to predict onion prices with the help of python libraries and resources to be contributed in Machine Learning field. We took data from data.world and data.gov.in for analysis of prices per gallon across various Indian States. This project can be implemented to various vegetables in future, But we took onion as specific vegetable as in recent years variation of Onion prices in our city "Bhopal" was variating a lot. So we came up with an idea that what if we make a project for onion price prediction, so that onions can be imported from other states which has lowest prices with harvesting months and price data. And in adverse condition like drought happen, how much storage can be kept for following months. Keeping in mind which state is producing and which is not.This project shows variation of Onion price across various 
states in various months and predicts price according.
